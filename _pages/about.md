dLLM-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with Adaptive Caching

Zhiyuan Liu *, Yicun Yang *, Yaojie Zhang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Qingyan Wei, Shaobo Wang, Linfeng Zhang.

Pioneered dLLM-Cache, a novel approach to accelerate diffusion large language models (dLLMs) by leveraging adaptive caching techniques.
dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1x speedup over standard dLLM pipelines, with no performance loss on most tasks.
